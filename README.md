# PROJECT_1
Dynamic Web Application :
  A candidate Management System with Python FLASK, HTML, CSS and SQLite.
  I have designed a web layout using HTML and CSS, incorporating Pythonâ€™s FLASK framework as the server-side programming
  language, and utilizing SQLite as the database.This platform allows candidates to create and update their information, while the
  admin has the ability to delete entries and view the complete list of candidates stored in the database
